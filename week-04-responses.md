# Hot and Cold Media 

An examples of hot media would be a podcast because it presents complete information and does not leave room to be filled or completed by the audience. In a podcast, the speaker is talking at you and hearing is the single intensely engaged sense.

An example of cold media would be a telephone call because it takes more participation and effort from the participant. There are multiple senses working together such as speach and hearing rathar than just one sense being engaged intently.
