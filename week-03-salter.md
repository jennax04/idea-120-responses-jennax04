# Contemporary Tools 

Contemporary artists have a vast array of  digital and physical tools at their disposal to create Gesamtkunstwerk, or total artwork. In the digital realm, software such as Adobe Creative Suite, Blender, and Unity enables artists to seamlessly blend various mediums like visual art, music, animation, and interactivity. Virtual reality and augmented reality  technologies offer experiences where viewers can engage with multisensory environments, which  blur the lines between the physical and digital worlds. These tools allow artists to craft holistic experiences that stimulate multiple senses and evoke emotional responses.

An example of a Gesamtkunstwerk from the Rhizome Anthology that showcases the potential of contemporary tools is "Deep Lab." Deep Lab is a collaborative project involving artists and technologists who explore topics at the intersection of art, technology, and society. Through workshops, discussions, and experiments, Deep Lab members produce works that challenge conventional boundaries and push the limits of interdisciplinary collaboration. Their projects often incorporate digital tools like data visualization, computer programming, and networked communication to address social, political, and cultural issues. By embracing a diverse range of mediums and methodologies, Deep Lab exemplifies how contemporary artists can use technology to create immersive and thought-provoking Gesamtkunstwerk.
